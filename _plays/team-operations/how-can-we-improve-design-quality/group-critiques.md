Objectives and key results (usually known as 'OKRs') are a way of setting simple, easily measurable goals within teams. OKRs are not only great for tracking the success of a project, but the process of setting them helps teams clarify what's important, and why.

---

## When to run
Run this at the start of a project, or at specific intervals (e.g. every quarter).

They can be set at company, team, and individual levels.

---

## Why to run
OKRs provide a way of ensuring that the most important things are being worked on. They also serve as a way of looking back and evaluating successes and failures — useful for setting future goals, and seeing where teams might need some extra help.

## How to run
GV's Rick Klau has a great talk and write-up of how OKRs work within Google. Some highlights from the post:

> Here are a few keys to what make OKRs work at Google:
- Objectives are ambitious, and should feel somewhat uncomfortable
- Key Results are measurable; they should be easy to grade with a number (at Google we use a 0–1.0 scale to grade each key result at the end of a quarter)
- OKRs are public; everyone in the company should be able to see what everyone else is working on (and how they did in the past)
- The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is .6 — .7; if someone consistently gets 1.0, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough. Low grades shouldn’t be punished; see them as data to help refine the next quarter’s OKRs.

## Pro tips
Don't think of OKRs as a proxy for performance reviews for individual employees. As [Rick states][gv-guide]:

> OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations. OKRs are about the company’s goals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance evaluations — which are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period — should be independent from their OKRs.
