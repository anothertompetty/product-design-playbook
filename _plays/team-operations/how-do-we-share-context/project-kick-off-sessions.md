A good kick-off session is a way of bringing the team together to establish the goals, roles, and scope of a project. It can also help surface any issues, previous experience, or other related context that can easily get lost across teams.

This isn't the same as a sprint planning session, as it covers a lot more than implementation details.

## When to run
Run this once the team is in place, but before work starts on any new project.

## Why to run
Without agreeing up front, it's common for there to be confusion within teams with regards to who is responsible for what â€” this often leads to unneccessary disagreements, or tension. Kick-offs provide a space to explicitly discuss, and agree on roles and responsibilities.

Kick-offs are also an ideal place to set goals, and define what success looks like.

Finally, they can help uncover any blockers or underlying issues which might hold up progress, or affect the chance of meeting the goal.

## How to run
There are five different parts to a well run kick-off session. The team agrees and appoints a facilitator who will run through the questions and take notes. The facilitator is also responsible for making sure the session isn't dominated by one or two people, and that everyone in the room is heard. 

### Part 1: Purpose
- What problem does this project address? (Or what [provocation][provocation] are we responding to?)
- What exactly are we planning to do?
- How might it impact each area of the business?

### Part 2: Scope
- What is and isn't in scope for the project?
- What are the key stages / sprints required?
- What does success look like? Which goals / OKRs / KPIs does this address?
- How will we measure success?

### Part 3: Team
- Who's on the team?
- What's each person's role?
- Who else might we need to talk to in order to finish the project?

### Part 4: Process
- How are we going to update each other? Standups? Slack?
- How are we going to track progress? Jira? Trello? 
- How are we going to feel like a team? Sit together?

### Part 5: Next Steps
- Schedule a detailed sprint planning or scoping meeting.
- Send Kick-off email to the wider company.

After this the facilitator will write up the session notes and distribute to the wider team, or company. This can be via Google Docs, Slack, or email.

## Roles
- Facilitator: organises the meeting, controls the pace, and ensures everyone is heard. 
- Note taker: captures what's agreed, and any next steps. Can be the the same person as the facilitator.
- Attendees: everyone else on, or directly involved in, the project.

## Pro tips
Try and book the kick-off for the day work begins on the project, ideally in the morning. They don't work well when done more than a few days before work starts, or more than a few days after work has started.
