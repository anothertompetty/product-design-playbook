Retrospectives are a forum for a team to come together after each project and discuss successes, failures, learnings, and note down anything that will be useful in the future. It's a cathartic exercise designed to help teams and companies continously learn and improve.

It's worth nothing that retrospectives are not an appropriate platform for personal feedback. This should be done separately in one-to-one sessions.

## When to run
Run this once a project has finished, ideally before the next one kicks off. 

---

## Why to run
To continue learning, improving, and growing, it's important for teams to look back and take stock of their progress, and performance. Retrospectives help surface the good things, as well as the bad. This means more of what works, and less of what doesn't.

Retrospectives are also a good way to capture and share any context from the project that might be useful in the future — the rationale for decisions, what wasn't done and why, and what might need to be revisited.

## How to run
There are seven different sections, with set questions to ask for each.

The team agrees and appoints a facilitator who will run through the questions and take notes. The facilitator is also responsible for making sure the session isn't dominated by one or two people, and that everyone in the room is heard. 

### Sections:
- Kick-off: did we hit the ground running with the right plan?
- Scope: did we stick to what we initially scoped?
- Team: was everyone who needed to be on the project part of the team?
- Communication: did everybody know what they needed to know all the time?
- Goals: Can we call this a success or not yet?
- End Product: are we happy with what we've built?
- Learning: did everyone on the project get opportunities to learn?

### Suggested Questions for each section:
- Things that went well
    - What went well?
    - Why did it go well?
    - How do we keep encouraging that? 
- Things that didn't go so well:
    - What went badly?
    - Why did it go badly?
    - How do we avoid repeating that?

After this the facilitator will write up the session notes and distribute to the wider team, or company. This can be via Google Docs, Slack, or email.

## Roles
- Facilitator: organises the meeting, controls the pace, and ensures everyone is heard. 
- Note taker: captures what's agreed, and any next steps. Can be the the same person as the facilitator.
- Attendees: everyone else on, or directly involved in, the project.

## Pro tips
Try and book the retrospective as close as possible to the conclusion of the work as possible. The more time that's left, the harder it will be to recall everything accurately.
