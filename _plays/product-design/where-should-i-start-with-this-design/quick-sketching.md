This is a great way to rapidly generate a broad set of ideas for features and user journeys, and not waste time on less-than-perfect solutions. Quick sketching provides solid foundations for designers to build on and explore in higher fidelity.

## When to run
When beginning design on a new feature or project. Could come when responding to a [provocation][provocation], or could be used to define requirements for things like content.

---

## Why to run
It can be tempting and easy to leap straight into visuals, or to settle on the first idea that seems feasible. This forces focus away from look and feel, and onto content, structure, and hierarchy.

---

## How to run
- Grab an few large (ideally dotted A3) sheets of paper.
- Draw a grid of 12 box on each sheet. Match to aspect ratio of what you're designing (e.g. mobile, desktop).
- If you're designing a page (e.g. a website), sketch a different idea in each box. If you're designing a feature that has a more complex user journey (e.g. onboarding), sketch each part of the journey from beginning to end.
- Pay particular focus to content, concept, and layout. Don't get lost on small details or flourishes.
- Use real words whenever possible — don't just draw wiggly lines. This means it can be evaluated properly later on.
- Go broad. Try and do 20 versions. The obvious ideas will have exhausted in five, meaning the interesting concepts start to creep in.
- Go and get a cup of tea. Don't look at the page for a good five minutes. 
- Come back fresh and pick the 'winners'. Which ideas stand out? Which meet the brief most accurately? Try and settle on three to work up larger, in more granular detail.

### Next steps

- Sketch the three favourites in detail: What comes before this section? What comes after? How will users transition from one state to the other?
- Share the sketches with the immediate team. Get feedback on the design and feasibility, but focus most on how they meet the brief.
- These sketches can sometimes be used in tests with users, or as a starting point for a clickable prototype. See related plays for details.

## Roles
- Sketcher: Someone to iterate on ideas.
- Critiquers: People to give feedback and support. 

---

## Pro tips
- When doing the initial sketches, write just the headlines — don't worry about filling in body copy.
- If the sketches look good, or like an interface, they've had too much time spent on them!
