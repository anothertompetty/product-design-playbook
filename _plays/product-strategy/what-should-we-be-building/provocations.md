title: Provocations
situation: What should we be building?
section: Product strategy & direction
---

Provocations are simply questions and challenges beginning wth _‘how might we…’_. Based on user research, they hold layers of need and insight (helping steer products in the right direction), yet don’t prescribe or presume a solution (allowing teams autonomy and flexibility in finding answers).

Some examples:
- How might we help people plan a whole trip, instead of just booking a flight?
- How might we make customers feel more in control of their energy usage?
- How might we allow developers to build on our services?

Provocations provide a great stimulus for teams, as they focus projects on customers, and can be prioritised to create a sort of roadmap for the next month, quarter etc.

This uses a cut down version of IDEO’s [human-centred design][design-kit] methodology.

## When to run
Run this when you’re unsure what the next phase of work should be. Can be organisation, product, team, or project specific.

---

## Why to run
It’s best to have some form of plan for what to work on, but a detailed roadmap isn’t always the answer. They can be too predictive, leading to projects that aren’t always the right thing to be working on; or too prescriptive, leading to teams feeling boxed in. Provocations provide a repeatable way of ensuring teams are doing accurate — and empowering — work.

## How to run
This can be split into two phases: research, and analysis.

### Phase one: Research
This is all about uncovering real customer needs and and understanding motivation. It will provide the raw material to work with later on. Repeat exposure to customers also helps build a good judgement muscle for making product decisions.

### Process
- Try and have 10 to 15 different conversations with customers who are representative of your user base.
- At least two (but not more than three) people are needed: one to interview, one to take notes.
- Ask the customers to tell stories of their experiences related to your product's industry. The focus should be on real situations and emotions felt, not analysis of past situaitons (people are notoriously bad at that).
- Start broad (life, values), then drill down and go specific (product).
- Make sure to record verbatim quotes, and discuss immediately afterwards, capturing more detailed notes whilst they’re fresh in the mind.

### Outcome
A lot of notes, quotes, and observations from the interviews.

### Phase 2: Analysis
This section is designed to turn understanding into insight. It allows layers of need and motivation to be captured in a succinct way. Framing these as questions helps turn them into actionable goals.

### Process
- Get a large room with moveable foam boards, or lots of whiteboard space.
- Gather the interviewing group together. If there are key decision makers, bring them in too.
- Start by sharing and telling stories from the interviews — get back into that mindset.
- Write quotes down on post-its and get them up on the wall. Try and recall them verbatim, but feel free to add context if necessary.
- Step back and look at what’s on the wall. Try and cluster the post-its into themes (e.g. _‘flexibility’_, _‘busy’_), and give each theme a name. 
- Tease out the truth behind each theme, and  re-phrase as an insight. A good format for this is ‘x is y’ (e.g. _‘flexibility is missing’_).
- Re-frame each insight as a question that starts with _‘how might we…’_ (e.g. _‘How might we make our plans more flexible?’_). These questions are the provocations. The ideal starting point for projects that keep user needs and motivation front of mind, whilst allowing teams flexibility in how they come to a solution.

### Outcome
A series of questions that, if approached thoughtfully, will provide direction for design and product teams.

## Roles
- Interviewers: leading conversations with customers.
- Note takers: recording quotes and making sure no detail slips through the net.
- Facilitator: running the session to generate insights.

---

## Pro tips
- During the interviews, observing body language and tone is just as important as recording the words.
- Try and avoid the word ‘user’ in your provocations. Instead, use ‘people’, or ‘customer’ (even if your product is free, this keeps the focus on an exhange of value).
